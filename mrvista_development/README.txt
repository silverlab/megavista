Fixes and local updates from the SilverLab to the mrVista sources.

The files in this directory are meant to be copies of original mrVista
matlab routines, modified for lab use with fixes and other updates.

These are things that are meant to overwrite mrVista functionality, so
you need to configure your matlab search path (typically done with a
startup.m script) to include this directory above the main mrvista
search path.
