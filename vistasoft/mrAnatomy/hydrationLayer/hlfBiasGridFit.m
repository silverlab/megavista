%   not like the article i'm not work on all brain but only on the WM. also
%   i will use step 1-8 only to define the ROI but the data that is used
%   for the gridfit are the data in the original gPDT2* and  not the smooth
%   data.

%% Check input arguments here


%% Algorithm begins 
%  Exclude voxels that: T1<0 (.2) T1>5000 (1000) ms
%  Exclude voxels that PD_0<0 PD_0 -the pd that come from t1 fit.
%  Exclude any voxel that is less then 5% from the mean

% i find deside to use 100 contol point but this is abit arbitrary.
