%
% Finds a map between the mesh vertices and gray nodes.
% To see the coordinates of the gray matter node (or nodes) nearest to  
% mesh vertex I, we can use:
%    
%      nearestNodeCoords = grayNodes(1:3, v2gMap(:,I))
%
%
% If the grayEdges are also passed in, then we'll compute the mapping for
% all gray layers. Layer 1 mapping will be in the first row, and layers
% >1 in subsequent columns. As always, vertices with no mapping will be set
% to 0.
%
% The vertexGrayMap now has multiple rows to represent mappings from
% each vertex (the columns) to all gray layers. This mapping is computed in
% two steps:
%
% 1. For each vertex, find the nearest layer 1 gray node, where 'nearest'
% is simply the smallest 3d Euclidian distance, with a threshold to leave
% vertices that are too far from any layer 1 nodes unmapped (zero entry in
% vertexGrayMap). This threshold is currently set to 4mm- edit
% mrmMapVerticesToGray if you want to change this. This layer-1 mapping
% forms the first column of the vertexGrayMap. 
%
% 2. For each vertex (row), find all the nodes from layers >1 that should
% map to this vertex. This is a somewhat ill-posed problem, so we had to
% make a choice about which solution we wanted. We decided to use the gray
% layer connections to find all the layer >1 nodes that form a direct
% connection to the nearest layer 1 node that we mapped in step 1. As you
% discovered, this gives us a very redundant sampling of the gray nodes.
% The number of nodes >1 that are most directly connected to a given layer
% 1 node can be very high, especially in regions of high convexity. The
% algorithm for doing this essentially starts at the highest layers and
% maps them down to the most direct (ie. shortest path) layer 1 node. In a
% region of GM at the end of a thick finger of WM, this can map many nodes
% to one layer 1 node (apparently 84 in one case). The vertexGrayMap is an
% array, so the number of columns represents the most densely connected
% case. If you look at it, there are probably only a few vertices with as
% many as 84 connections. Most vertices probably have lots of zeros in
% those higher columns. In fact, in regions of high concavity, you should
% see some with no layers >1 (ie. a row with all zeros except for the first
% column).
%
% We realize that this choice of implementation might not be what everyone
% wants. But it works pretty well for our purposes. Of course, one downside
% to the highly redundant mapping is an effective 'smoothing' of the data,
% especially when you choose to average all layers (in your 3d window
% preferences settings). What we do is look at our data collapsed across
% layers as well as combining all layers, just to make sure we aren't
% missing something.

% HISTORY:
%  2003.09.16 RFD (bob@white.stanford.edu)
%  2004.05.21 RFD: now uses Dan Merget's nearpoints to find a proper
%  mapping. No more hacks! Aside from being a bit faster, the result should
%  be substantially more accurate.
%  2005.07.26 RFD: We now return a mapping for all gray layers, if
%  grayEdges is passed in.
%  2005.08.05 RFD: all gray layer mapping is turned off by default, until
%  we figure out how to make it go faster.
%  2005.10.26 GB: Tentative speed improvement in the main loop
%  2006.06.01 RFD: added comments above. These were prompted by an email
%  exchange with David Ress.
%  2007.05.23 ARW : Gray layer mapping seems to be available. Which is
%  nice. Added some minor mods to return sqDist and detect dist thresholds.
