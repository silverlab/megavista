<h2>mrFlatMesh - A cortical unfolding program.<br></h2>
<h3>ARW 02.2001</h3><br>
<p>This the help system for mrFlatMesh.
<p>mrFlatMesh flattens meshes produced by the mrGray 3D visualisation module. It does this extremely
quickly using a system based on the solution of large, sparse, linear equations. As a rough guide, 
it will flatten a mesh containing about 100000 nodes in under a minute on a 400MHz Pentium. 
<p>However, a flat mesh on its own is no use to anyone. mrFlatMesh also maps a grey segmentation
file onto the unfolded mesh, and produces a 'flat.mat' file that gives a 2D location for every grey node
in the 3D grey segmentation. This can be used to generate 2D maps of 3D cortical activation patterns.
<p>This grey->mesh mapping is the slowest part of the program. However, mrFlatMesh is still relatively fast: 
it will unfold and map a region of cortex 50mm in radius in around 5 minutes. 100mm unfolds take about 
1/2 hour.<br>

<p>This is what mrFlatMesh looks like when it runs. It wants the following pieces of information before
you can begin an unfold.
<p>1) A gray matter file. This is produced by the program <a href="http://white.stanford.edu/~heeger/labmanual/mrGrayTips.html">mrGray</a>
Once you have produced a white matter segmentation in mrGray you grow gray matter onto it.<p><b>Important:</b> mrFlatMesh 
requires a gray file with <b>3</b> layers of gray matter. No more, no less. mrFlatMesh expects the gray file
to have the suffix '.gray'
<br>
<p>2) A mrGray mesh file. This is different from previous unfolding programs used in our lab. The mesh file
is produced by mrGray when you run the 3D visualisation module. It is useful because it is guaranteed to be
triangulated and well-behaved: none of the connections between nodes will cross each other. This means that
it can be unfolded using the sparse matrix method described below. Follow <a href="mrGrayMeshHelp.html">this link</a> to learn
how to make a mesh. mrFlatMesh expects the mesh file to have the suffix '.mrm'.
<p>3) Unfold parameters: Specifically, the radius of theunfold perimeter from the start point, the 
coordinates of the start point and some flags telling mrFlatMesh whether to display images of the
various stages of the mesh unfold, whether to save out extra information in the output file (recommended)
and how exactly to define the perimeter. If you're unsure about any of these options, leave them checked. They are 
described in more detail <a href="flagDetails.html">here</a>.
<p>4) An output file name. This is none other than the 'flat.mat' file that mrLoadRet looks for
when you ask it to open up a new flat window. A good naming convention for the flat file is<br>
<b>flat_<i>radius</i>_<i>hemisphere</i>.mat</b>. <p>So, for example, a left hemisphere unfold of
60mm would be flat_60_left.mat.<p>
<p>Then hit "GO". Everything should happen automatically, and the final flat.mat file should be dumped into the place you specified in 4). 
<p>You will see status messages popping up in the status window and during some 'quit' periods, the status bar will display a moving green bar to tell you that something is going on. <b>Beware though</b> there are two points where the program will seem to hang (solving the position equation and mapping layer 1 gray nodes to the mesh). You can use the windows task manager to make sure that the processor is still working during these periods - large unfolds (>80mm) take a long time in these routines - sometimes up to half an hour or more. If you interrupt Matlab at this point, you will lose all your work.
<p>When something goes wrong, check the Matlab command window and note the error message and what you did. Then send it to <a href="mailto:alexwade@stanford.edu"></a>
