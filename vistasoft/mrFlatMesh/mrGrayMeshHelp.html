<h3>This document describes how to make a mesh suitable for plugging into mrFlatMesh.</h3>
<p>1) Bring up mrGray. Load in your project, segment your white matter as usual and make sure
that the topology analysis tells you that you have no handles. 
<p>2) Now grow gray matter onto the white. Grow exactly 3 layers of gray matter, no more, no less. Save out the gray matter somewhere.<br>

<p>Now build a 3D visualisation. In the 3D visualisation tab box you want to make the following settings...
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray2.jpg" width="506" height="403" border="0" alt="">
<p>mrGray will automatically use the current gray file. 
<P><b>Make a note</b> of the voxel dimensions here - you will need to feed them into mrMeshUnfold later.
<p>The other tabs should look like this.....

<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray4.jpg" width="506" height="403" border="0" alt="">
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray5.jpg" width="506" height="403" border="0" alt="">
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray6.jpg" width="506" height="403" border="0" alt="">
<P>... and finally....
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray7.jpg" width="506" height="403" border="0" alt="">
<p>This final option tells mrGray where to save the mesh file. Make sure you save it somewhere
sensible and use the .MrM format. 
<p>Now go ahead and build the mesh. The .MrM file should automatically get saved out and you'll be presented
with a 3D view of the brain. 
<p>Finally, you can pick a start point for the unfold. Position the red, green and blue lines on the 3D volume
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray8.jpg" width="963" height="642" border="0" alt="">
<p>and make a note of the X,Y and Z values listed in the toolbar.
<p><img src="helpImages/mrGray9.jpg" width="189" height="422" border="0" alt="">
<p><b>and be careful!</b> Note that they're listed in reverse order here (Z,Y,X).
<p>You can also get these valuse by moving around in the 2D segmentation editing window.
