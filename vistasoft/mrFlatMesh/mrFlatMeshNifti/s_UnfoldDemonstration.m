% Create and unfold a mesh using the white matter classification
%
% THe unfold method creates a properly triangulated mesh from a white
% matter classification data set. A region of the mesh is identified for
% unfolding. Then the mesh is flattened using Floater/Tutte's linear  
% method. The method's principle is this:  Each vertex is assigned a
% position in the plane at a location equal to the average of its connected
% neighbors. Then maps layer one grey nodes to the flattened 
%
% The initial unfolding occurs just for the layer 1 (L1) levels. The
% remaining grey layers are then assigned a position corresponding to the
% position of the nearest L1 neighbor point.
%
%    1. Read in the white matter created by mrGray.  
%    2. Create the mesh that will be unfolded
%    3. Select the portion of the full mesh that is within the criterion
%    distance from the startCoords. 
%    3. Flatten this portion of the mesh.
%    4. [Optional]: The flat positions are adjusted to make the spacing more nearly
%    like the true distances.
%    5. Assign gray matter data to the flat map positions.

% mrReadMrM scales everything to voxel coords. So mrGray writes out a mesh
% in real world coordinates (say 0.5,0.5,0.5) and saves the voxel size(say
% 0.5x0.5x0.5) with the mesh. Then mrReadMrM returns the coordinate as [1 1
% 1] and tells you the voxel size it used. scaleFactorFromMesh is in
% mm/voxel.
% Boy, this needs to be explained again. (BW).

%-------------------------------------------------
% Step 1.  We build the mesh from the mrGray output mesh.  This contains
