function ui = mrViewSelectMesh(ui, n);
% Select a mesh (and its corresponding segmentation) in a mrViewer UI.
%
%  ui = mrViewSelectMesh(ui, [n=dialog]);
%
% This is an accessor function, originally designed to work with the mesh
% panel in the mrViewer GUI. This is as an alternative to the lower-level
% command line call "ui = mrViewSet(ui, 'curmesh', n);" -- this calls that
% code -- and works outside the mesh menu. 
%
% Mainly, I wanted to make using the interface easier while keeping the
% design of the UI data structure conceptually sensible. So, now in the
% mesh panel you can select from all meshes loaded, without having to
% sub-select the segmentation they belong to: easier. But the UI variable
% still has discrete segmentations, with meshes which belong to a given
% segmentation, which better corresponds to the distinct files which exist
% and which is cleaner.
%
% INPUTS:
%	ui: mrViewer ui.
%
%	n: number or name of mesh. For number, this will sort the meshes across
%	all segmentations, and n should be an index into that
%	across-segmentation list. For name, should be the name the mesh ID as a 
%	string -- I know that's unusual, but it seems that mesh ID (the window number 
%	in the mrMesh window) is a better unique identifier for each mesh than the 
%	name, and having it be a string is the only clean way to distinguish
%	indices from mesh ID numbers.
%	[default: put up a dialog with the names and ask the user.]
%
%
% OUTPUTS: ui with the selected mesh set as the current mesh, and the
% segmentation to which that mesh belongs set as the current segmentation
