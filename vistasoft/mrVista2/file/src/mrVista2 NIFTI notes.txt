A note about these files:

The NIFTI files in this directory represent an older set of files to 
that found in the VISTASOFT/filters/nifti directory. The newer files 
do not work out of the box, and need to be compiled separately for 
each machine and version of MATLAB. Conversely, these older files have
worked stably without a hiccup on many matlab versions and architectures.
I feel these functions work more stably and simply, so I am keeping them. 
But, to avoid namespace conflicts, I am appending "_stable" to the name
of each file.

The newer files correct a bug in this version, involving a 1 offset 
in the qto header field (which is used by some programs for rotating 
into canonical space). This field is not used by the mrVista2 
functions, but is used for some "mrAnat*" analyses (as well as external
programs like FSL). As things are now, the mrVista2 and Anatomy functions
each access separate versions and should get along well without confusion.
