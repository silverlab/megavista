% 
% Compares onsets derived from analog channel ('onsets') to the onsets
% derived from the matlab expt output file ('monsets'). Retained timestamps
% are output as 'truestamps'. Requirement for truestamps is that each event 
% exists in both matfile and analog channel. truestamps is the same length 
% as monsets, but with -1 in any cell for which there was no corresponding 
% analog onset (within maxdist).
% Each event is plotted (different color for each condition) on top of the
% analog onsets (green) so you can see whether the event alignment was
% performed correctly. Dots represent events identified in the analog
% channel, while X represent events recorded in the matfile.
% Excluded events are in magenta -- dot indicates an analog event with no
% accompanying monset, X indicates a monset with no analog event.
% 
% Input params: event file and onsets from analog channel
% Output params: event conditions and corresponding timestamps from analog
% channel (in seconds)
