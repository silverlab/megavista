% mrLoadRet can be quite snobbish about parameter maps
% that are 'unescorted' by corresponding co/amp/ph fields
% for the same scan. Rather than find all the code which
% assumes these fields will be there and fix them, it seems
% easier to make this code, which adds these fields to any
% scan with an assigned parameter map.
%
% For these scans, the code assigns a co field that reflects
% the normalized amplitude of whatever is in the parameter map 
% (so the cothresh button does restrict the param map); the ph 
% field is all zeros, and the amplitude fields is the same as
% the map field. 
%
% For future uses (such as contrast maps), it may make sense to 
% add further flexibility to this -- for instance, some GLM/contrast 
% map code will provide a map of an estimated contrast effect size 
% (difference between different stimulus conditions), as well as
% a statistic of how good the GLM fitting is. In this case, it makes
% sense to color code the amplitude of effect, but restrict to voxels
% satisfying a slideable statistical criterion, in the same way we can
% color code fitted sinewave amplitudes but restrict to a certain
% coherence criterion.
