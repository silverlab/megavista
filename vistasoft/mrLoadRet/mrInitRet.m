% mrInitRet (Script)
%
% Initialize data for mrVista
%
% Starts with reconstructed P*.mag files and corresponding inplane-anatomy
% images.  This script orchestrates the processing for various purposes.
% The directories are initialized, the time series are derived, and so
% forth.   These steps include
%
% - Set up directory structure
% - create inplane anatomy files 
% - crop data (inplanes and functionals)
% - Store parameters used for data analysis (dataTYPES, mrSESSION)
% - extract time series from mag files
%    - Remove drift
%    - Calculate percent
% - compute block time series analysis (coherence)
%
% The information about the processing is stored in the structure mrSESSION
% and dataTYPES.
%

% Programming Notes:
%
% DBR, 3/99  Rewritten based on an earlier version by GB, and
%    much hacked subsequently.
% Ress, 2/06  Added code to resize inplane images, which was anonymously
%   removed. Please DO NOT remove this code without contacting me!
% Rory, 02/06 Yeah, that was me -- sorry. But it said "ask Junjie" and
%    Junjie wasn't around. And it was never made clear what it was supposed to
%    be, or if it was just a brutal hack. Having a button definitely helps,
%    instead of having the same dialog each time.
