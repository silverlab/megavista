function view = meshGrowROI(view, name, startCoord, mask);
% Grow an ROI along the cortical surface, starting at the mesh cursor
% position and extending along a contiguous patch defined by the data in
% mask.
%
%  view = meshGrowROI([view], [name], [startCoord=cursor position], [mask=data overlay mask]);
%
% INPUTS:
%	view: mrVista gray view. [Defaults to selected gray.]
%
%	name: name of the new ROI. [Default is to call it 'Mesh ROI' with the
%	start coord appended.]
%
%	startCoord: coordinate of starting gray matter node. [Defaults to
%	position of cursor in currently-selected mesh.]
%
%	mask: binary data mask, size 1 x nNodes, indicating whether a given
%	node is acceptable to be included in the ROI. nNodes is the size of 
%	view.coords and view.nodes. If the start node is not 1, will warn the
%	user and exit without making an ROI. Will grow the ROI along the
%	view.edges field until there are no neighboring nodes for which mask is
%	1. [default: makes this mask based on the current mesh overlay and view
%	settings: if there is data shown on the overlay, the mask is 1; if not,
%	it's 0.]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%	view with a new ROI added (if one could be created).
%
% NOTE: This function uses iteration, and so if the data mask is mostly
% ones (the ROI has to grow a lot), the function can be memory
% intensive / may fail to finish due to the MATLAB iteration limit. Also,
% growing along the cortical surface is different from growing in the
% volume space. It is sensitive to the alignment/segmentation, so those
% should be in good order before this can be trusted.
%
% Finally, if you move the mesh (Ctrl + moving the mouse), this can mess up
% the correspondence between the mesh cursor position and the volume nodes.
% So, you can''t do that and have this keep working. (If you do this by
% accident, but you've saved some view settings, you can restore those
% settings and things should work again.)
