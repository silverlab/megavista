%  Gets the current mrMesh cursor location and transforms it to mrVista
%  volume coordiantes.
%
% There are currently 3 ways to map the cursor to the VOLUME:
%
% 1. map the 3d cursor location directly to volume coords. This is the
% least accurate, since even smoothing the mesh will throw it off. If the
% mesh is not a real surface (eg. it's a cut plane or a DTI fiber), then
% this method will be used, since we have no other choice.
% 
% 2. get the vertex index of the cursor and then find the 3d location of
% that vertex in the volume space. This avoids the smoothing problem in
% method 1, but is not consistent with all other mapping code that uses the
% vertexToGray map. This method will only be used if the vertex-to-gray
% transform field of the msh struct doesn't exist or is empty.
%
% 3. get the vertex index of the cursor and use the vertex-to-gray
% transform associated with the mesh to map these to layer-1 gray nodes.
% Then, we can just take the 3d coordinates of those layer 1 nodes. This is
% the most accurate method and is consistent with all our other mapping
% code. This method will be used by default, if it can.
