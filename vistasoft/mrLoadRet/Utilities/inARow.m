function [maxInRow,vals,count] = inARow(vec);% INAROW: counts the max number of times each value in a vector occurs in a row, one after the other.% Usage: [maxInRow,vals,count] = inARow(vec);% E.g. suppose we have the following vector:% %	1 1 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1 % 	% The value '1' is repeated up to three times in a row in this vector, '2' up to four times in a row, and % '3' only once in a row -- it's never repeated. The output for this vector would therefore be: %%	3 4 1%% indicating the max. number of times in a row each value had occurred.%% 'maxInRow' contains the max repeat numbers shown above.% 'vals' contains the corresponding value in vec for each max repeat value.% 'count' records how many times each value was repeated the max times.% % 11/02 by rasN = length(vec);repNumVec = seqrepeats(vec);vals = unique(vec);for i = 1:length(vals)	Ind = find(vec==vals(i));	maxInRow(i) = max(repNumVec(Ind));	count(i) = length(find(repNumVec(Ind)==maxInRow(i)));endreturn
