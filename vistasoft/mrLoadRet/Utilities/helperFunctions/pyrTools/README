This package contains some of my MatLab tools for multi-scale image
processing.  Briefly, the tools include:
  - Recursive multi-scale image decompositions (pyramids), including
    Laplacian pyramids, QMFs, Wavelets, and steerable pyramids.  These
    operate on 1D or 2D signals of arbitrary dimension.  Data
    structures are compatible with the MatLab wavelet toolbox.
  - Fast 2D convolution routines, with subsampling and boundary-handling.
  - Fast point-operations, histograms, histogram-matching.
  - Fast synthetic image generation: sine gratings, zone plates, fractals, etc.
  - Display routines for images and pyramids.  These include several
    auto-scaling options, rounding to integer zoom factors to avoid 
    resampling artifacts, and useful labeling (dimensions and gray-range).

The package is available as a gnu-zipped UNIX "tar" file, via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cis.upenn.edu (IP number 158.130.12.3) in the
file pub/eero/matlabPyrTools.tar.gz.  You may also access it from my
Home page http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eero.  

The code works in Matlab versions 4.2 and higher, and has been tested
on Sun and Macintosh platforms (it should, however, port easily to
others).  To use the code (these lines are for a UNIX workstation):
  1) gunzip matlabPyrTools.tar.gz  	# unpack g'zipped file
  2) tar tvf matlabPyrTools.tar       	# view contents
  3) tar xvf matlabPyrTools.tar       	# extract contents
  4) rm matlabPyrTools.tar 		# delete tarfile
  5) Run matlab, and execute:
      path(<pathname-of-matlabPyrTools>, path);
      help matlabPyrTools

A few functions are actually MEX interfaces to C code.  These are
contained in the subdirectory called MEX.  You may need to recompile
these (by running "make" in the <dir>/MEX directory), and copy or
link the resulting mex files into the main directory.  The MEX files
have been tested on Sun's Solaris and SunOS-4.X operating systems,
LinuX on a Pentium platform, and on a PPC macintosh, but should not be
difficult to compile on most other platforms.

Some example script files showing usage of the code are in the
directory <dir>/TUTORIALS.  There is a README file in that directory
describing the contents.

Incremental changes to the code are documented in the ChangeLog file.
