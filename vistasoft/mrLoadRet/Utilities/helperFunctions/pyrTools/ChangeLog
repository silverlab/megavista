Fri Aug 29 13:49:16 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* showIm.m: Modified to behave better under resizing (and printing):
	resets axis units to "normalized".

Thu Aug 28 22:56:52 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* MEX/edges.c: reflect1, reflect2, repeat, extend upgraded to work
 	properly for non-symmetric filters.  reflect2 and extend were also
 	broken for upConv.  Added qreflect2 to handle even-length QMF's
 	which broke under the reflect2 modification.
	* Added example code to TUTORIALS/matlabPyrTools to illustrate the
	boundary-handling behavior...
	
Thu Aug 21 13:34:17 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* var2, skew2, kurt2: modified to return complex values for complex images.
	* imStats.m: now gives an error for complex args.

Thu Aug 14 15:24:29 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Modified shift.m: negated the meaning of the offset parameter,
	such that RES=shift(MTX,OFFSET) means RES(POS)=MTX(POS-OFFSET)
	(this is more intuitive).

Thu Jul 10 17:06:52 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Modified MEX/Makefile-* to be consistent with matlab5:
	   - call mex instead of cmex
	   - use -V4 flag (creating matlab v4 compatible binaries)
	
	* showIm.m (xlbl_offset): Modified to use "points" units, so that
	printed images look correct.  Still busted for arbitrary figure
	window sizes...  Also, still busted for printing.
	
	* Modified upConv.c: does not return ANYTHING if you pass a result
 	argument (this had been causing occasional problems with matlab's 
	memory manager).
	
Mon Jun 30 12:09:30 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* reconSFpyr.m (res): now returns real part (oops).

	* reconSpyrLevs.m (maxLev): got rid of superfluous nbands argument
 	(can be calculated from bfilts).

Mon May 26 12:29:54 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* showIm.m/pgmWrite.m: Modified 'auto3'-scaling to use a
 	histogram.  This gives a significant speedup.

	* fixed a few minor bugs in the TUTORIALS, having to do with 
	matching image sizes to the machine speed...

Sat May 10 17:27:25 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* pgmWrite.m: fixed auto-scaling bug.  Added new scaling
	calculations, parallel to those of imShow.

Fri May  9 09:02:56 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* buildSFpyr.m: Changed NBANDS argument to be ORDER, which is one
 	less than the number of orientation bands.  This is consistent
 	with the derivative order, and the labels on the spNFilters files.

Tue May  6 19:08:18 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Added buildSFpyr, reconSFpyr: Steerable pyramids constructed
        in the Fourier domain.  Radial functions tile, with a
	raised-cosine falloff.  Angular functions are
        cos(theta-k\pi/(K+1))^K, where K is the order (number of bands
	minus 1).  Compared to the convolution version:
	    + Reconstruction is exact (within floating point errors) 
	    + Can produce any number of orientation bands. 
	    - Typically slower.
	    - Boundary-handling must be circular.
	Could be made much more efficient by taking advantage of symmetries in
	the fft!
	
	* Added example usage of Fourier steerable pyramid to TUTORIALS/pyramids.m
	
	* steer.m:  fixed for harmonic lists including zero.

Sun May  4 15:16:10 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@ferrando.cns.nyu.edu>

	* MEX/Makefile-linux: created.
	
	* spyrHt, spyrNumBands: Modified to return 0 for pyramids of height 0.
	
	* reconWpyr.m: utilize desctructive addition in calls to upConv.
	
	* reconSpyr.m: Added error check to ensure consistecy between
	pyramid and filter file.  Utilize destructive addition in upConv
	call on highpass band.  Modified to work properly with pyramids of
	height 0.
	
Mon Apr 28 13:38:10 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@ferrando.cns.nyu.edu>

	* lplot.m: modified to handle complex vectors,  use standard MatLab 
	  indices, and show minimal axes.  Added xrange parameter to allow
	  adjustment of X axis labeling.

Sun Apr 27 20:20:41 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* var2, skew2, kurt2: enhanced to work on complex matrices.
	
Sat Apr 26 11:16:12 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Changed parent directory (and distribution) name:
		   matlabImTools -> matlabPyrTools

	* namedFilter.m: Added two more Daubechies filters, and modified
	names to match the reference (e.g., daub2 is now a 4-tap filter).

        * Added vectorize.m: trivial function to pack matrix into vector (i.e., 
	computes mtx(:)).
	
	* Added upBlur.m: Upsample and blur (parallels blurDn).

Sun Apr 13 14:23:38 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* TUTORIALS/pyramids.m: Added plots of Fourier spectra for Wavelet bases.
	
	* make-tar-file: switched from compress to  gzip  for the
	distribution tarfile.

	* namedFilter.m: Added a few even-length QMF's from Johnston80.

Fri Apr 11 19:16:21 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* buildWpyr.m, reconWpyr.m: Modified slightly, so that subsampling
	lattice is better for even-length filters.
	
	* TUTORIALS/pyramids.m: Substantially overhauled.
	
Thu Apr 10 15:20:23 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* blurDn.m: added this function to downsample an image by a factor
 	2^L.

	* Fixed minor bug in upConv.m: errors in image size checking.

Mon Apr  7 13:25:37 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Changed TUTORIALS/matlabImTools.m to use histo.mex instead of
 	matlab's hist.

Wed Apr  2 13:20:55 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Incorporated Denis Pelli's ThinkC and MetroWorks projects for
 	Macintosh versions of the MEX code, along with MEX binaries.  These
 	are included as an HQX'ed self-extracting archive
 	(Macintosh-MEX.sit.hqx), in the MEX subdirectory.

Tue Apr  1 15:35:31 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* edges.c: modified by Denis Pelli to support THINK C.  * edges.c:
	
 	* histo.c, upConv.c, corrDn.c: minor changes in error message
 	printouts, to work around bugs in THINK C.
	
	* Included Denis Pelli's MacReadMe file in the MEX subdirectory,
 	which gives instructions for MEX file compilation on a MacIntosh
 	(PPC or 68k).
	
	* wrap.c, convolve.c, edges.c: added explicit int function
 	declarations, and return values.

	* range2.m/range2.c: A MEX function for fast min/max computation.
  	Adjusted entropy2.m, histo.m, imStats.m, pgmWrite.m, showIm.m,
 	showLpyr.m, showSpyr.m, showWpyr.m to call it.
	  
Thu Mar 27 17:23:05 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* histo.m/histo.c: Added MEX function HISTO, a fast replacement
 	for matlab's HIST function.  Modified histoMatch.m, entropy2.m to
 	call it.
	
	* Changed main directory  name to matlabImTools.
	
	* Added TUTORIALS/README file.
	
Wed Mar 19 14:19:51 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Changed directory name: MEX_SRC -> MEX

Wed Mar 12 17:00:03 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* mkGaussian.m: fixed another (X,Y) bug: both dimensions and 
	cov/mean are now specified in [y,x] order.

Tue Mar 11 19:08:17 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* showSpyr.m: Fixed a bug that was dropping display of one
	orientation band when there were more than 2 of them!

Mon Mar 10 19:08:24 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@chrysothemis.cims.nyu.edu>

	* Added shift.m
	
	* makeSteerMtx -> steerDir2HarmMtx
	
	* Added TUTORIALS/matlab-EPS.m: examples using the code in this
 	distribution.

Sun Mar  9 17:49:18 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* showIm.m:  
	  - args: changed order so that NSHADES is last.
	  - TITLES: Can now pass a string for IM, which will be evaluated
 	    in the global environment to get the matrix.  The string is
 	    used as a title.  MATLAB v.5 ONLY!!!
          - Added 'auto3' RANGE value, that scales based on percentiles.
	    THis is more robust to outliers than 'auto2' or 'auto1'.
	
	* pixelAxes.m: Made a more serious attempt to reverse-engineer
 	  Mathworks' image pixelization.  It is improved, but still makes
 	  occasional errors.
	
	* Added skew2.m.
	
Fri Mar  7 10:11:07 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* pixelAxes.m: Modified to take an optional
	ZOOM argument.  Fixed dimension ordering bug
	(positions are reported (x,y), but mtx dims are (y,x)!)
	
	* showIm.m: Added an optional ZOOM argument.

Thu Mar  6 14:17:19 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Added showLpyr, showWpyr, showSpyr.  Modified
 	TUTORIALS/pyramids.m to use them.
	
	* added pixelAxes.m: Adjusts size (in pixels) of currently
	displayed image to be a multiple of the matrix dimensions, 
	thus eliminating display aliasing artifacts.
	 This is now called by all the "show" commands.

Mon Mar  3 17:33:25 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Fixed bug in pgmWrite (dimensions were written in reverse order).

	* Fixed bug in showIm (X and Y coords were swapped on label display).
	
	* Fixed bug in reconLpyr (swapped X and Y coords on int_sz)
	
	* Changed calls to "reshape" to pass dimensions individually --
	older version of matlab do not accept the reshape(mtx,[y x]) form.
	
	* Fixed bug in mkDisc: sz a scalar.
	
	* Added ifftshift.m
	
Fri Feb 28 11:07:20 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>
	
	* Re-worked TUTORIALS/pyramids.m

	* buildGpyr and buildLpyr now use 1+maxPyrHt for default height.
	
	* Fixed buildGpyr to work on 1D signals.
	
	* Gaussian/Laplacian/Wavelet pyramid build and recon functions:
	  - work properly with new corrDn/upConv.
	  - use separable convolutions 
	  - use destructive modification ability of upConv (less memory
 	  allocation)
	
	* modulateFlipShift -> modulateFlip.
	
	* added lpyrHt, wpyrHt, spyrHt to return number of levels in a pyramid.
	
Thu Feb 27 15:39:53 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Changed angular coordinate systems to CLOCKWISE in mkRamp,
 	mkTheta, mkSine, mkSquare.  This is unnatural for screen viewing,
 	but consistent with an origin in the upper left corner of the
 	image, which is the way one addresses the underlying matrix.

	* mkSine and mkSquare can now take a frequency vector or the 
	  period and direction args
	
Tue Feb 25 11:58:33 1997  Eero Simoncelli  <eero@servilia.cns.nyu.edu>

	* Rewrote corrDn/upConv C routines:
	  - more efficient
	  - changed START parameters to have [1 1] origin, consistent with
    	    matlab
	  - added STOP parameters
	  - upConv allows destructive modification of a result arg
	  - changed order of other params (sorry)
	  - wrote test file conv_test.m
	* wrote zconv2.m

Wed Aug 19 20:39:15 1996  Eero Simoncelli  (eero@tarpon.cis.upenn.edu)

	* Added "pointOp" function (MUCH faster than interp1).
	* Added "histoMatch" function.

Fri Aug  2 00:56:31 1996  Eero Simoncelli  (eero@tarpon.cis.upenn.edu)

	* Changed all function/file-names to be of the form "fooBar".  *
 	Fixed entropy2.m (busted due to typo).

Original convolution code was written in Spring 1986, and comes from
OBVIUS (Object-Based Vision and Image Understanding System), an
interactive image-processing system written in Common Lisp (with calls
to C code).
