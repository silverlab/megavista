% This script has to be executed directly in the command line
% It computes the MSE and the MI for the current Inplane.
%
% For each data type, it tries to compute 3 errors:
%       - Total error (without ROI)
%       - Error with the ROIdef
%       - Error with the ROI associated with this data type
%
% If it does not find the ROI concerned, it skips to the next computation.
%
% example:
%
%   close all
%   clear all
%   mrVista
%   vw = getSelectedInplane;
%   computeError
