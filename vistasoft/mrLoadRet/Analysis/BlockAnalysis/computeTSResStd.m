% djh, 11/00  Calls new version of percentTSeries that has the option of dividing
%             by spatialGradient (estimate of intensity inhomogeneity) instead
%             of dividing by mean at each pixel. Changed input arguments
%             correspondingly.

% This last step converts it so that it is an estimate of the reliability across
% repeated scans. The reliability of the amplitude estimate depends of course
% on the number of time samples in each scan. For a sinusoid plus noise:
