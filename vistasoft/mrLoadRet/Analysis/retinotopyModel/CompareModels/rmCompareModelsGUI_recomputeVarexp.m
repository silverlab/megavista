% This modifies the stored variance explained field in the M structure used
% by the GUI, using the prediction code used to plot the predicted time
% courses, rather than the original model's RSS estimates. The reason is
% that there seems to be some issue with the model's estimates: for certain
% cases, the predicted variance explained by the model is clearly far too
% high, and both the time series and predictions are visibly very noisy. 
% This probably has something to do with having a low raw root-sum-squared
% error in the data (varexp = 1 - (model RSS / raw RSS)). 
%
% But until that's clearly debugged (and possibly, models are re-solved),
% this function can clean up the estimates within a GUI.
%
% Note that this process may take a while.
