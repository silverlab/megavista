        % Making the 2D pRF is complicated. Here is why. Kendrick uses a
        % square grid and no units. He then makes a 2D Gaussian given the
        % center and size of the pRF in units of pixels (not degrees). He
        % then forces the vector length of this pRF to be equal to one. We
        % would like to re-create this same 2D pRF because the gain we have
        % stored for our model was calculated assuming this Gaussian.
        % However we need to return a 2D Gaussian within a circular
        % aperture, whose coordinates (in degrees of visual angle) are
        % described by the variables X,Y. We don't have X and Y in units of
        % pixels and we cannot easily create the pRF using Kendrick's code
        % and then crop out the regions outside our circular aperture.
        % Instead, we use a rather tedious alternative approach. We create
        % the Gaussian on a square grid using Kendrick's method. Then we
        % figure out the scale factor we need to multiply this by to get a
        % vector length of 1. Then we create a 2D Gaussian using Serge's
        % code, and we rescale by the appropriate scale factor. There must
        % be an easier way...
