function EvaluationMetric = kmeansScreePlot(E, maxNclusters)
%Build a scree plot for k-means clustering of fibers applied to their embedded
%space representation

%Input: E(Nxnvecs) (loadings of N fibers in the embedded space of nvecs dimensions)
%maxNclusters (optional) is the largest number of clusters you want to allow
%if not provided, will be set to N
%Will perform  clustering maxNclusters times and will produce a scree plot  (evaluation graph)
%Returns a vector of EvaluationMetric s for 1-N clusters
