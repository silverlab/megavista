%%%WTF??????? I wrote this and I thought I saved periodically, but it looks
%%%like there's no trace of it after the @#*(%&(*& xwindows crashed.

% To restore, copy code from Bob's dtiFiberUI dialog (e.g., xform/translate
% ROIs. Pass in as cells a long list of the parameters users can edit, plus
% default values from ctrCreate. Don't forget to grab and output what the
% user does. Also, fix the Q#(*%&(*#%& ctrInit.fig\
%
% ALSO: we pass in params and pass out params and change a field here as a
% flag to indicate that the ctrInitParamsFile should use the values already
% in PARAMS rather than reset them.
