%O'Donnell PhD Thesis (2006): measure clustering solution reliability
%We quantified this clustering variability by testing whether pairs
%of data points (paths from tractography) clustered always in the same cluster, never
%in the same cluster, or sometimes in the same and sometimes in different clusters.
%The fraction of pairs that sometimes were in the same cluster, and sometimes in
%different clusters, was measured for various numbers of clusters -- thus
%producing evaluation graph

%"In any case, the fraction of pairs that are inconsistent is less than 5 percent for any number of clusters greater
%than about 75."
