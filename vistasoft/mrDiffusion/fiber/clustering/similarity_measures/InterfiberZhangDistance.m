function [Dt, totalDist] = InterfiberZhangDistance(curve1, curve2, Tt)
%Distance between two 3D paths, defined as two 3xN sets of 3d coordinates. 
%
% [Dt, totalDist] = InterfiberZhangDistance(curve1, curve2, [Tt=2])
%
% The terms Dt and totalDist need better definition here.
%
% The metric is described in Zhang et al. (2003) IEEE Transactions on
% Vizualization and Computer Graphics 9(4).  They write:
%
% �In order to emphasize important differences between a pair of
% trajectories, we average the distance between the curves only over the
% region where they are at least Tt apart; smaller differences are assumed
% to be insignificant�. 
% 
% Although arguable, it is natural to set Tt to data voxel size /not sure,
% before or after resampling/ (as Zhang 2003 did). Here the default value
% is set to 1mm despite the fact that out data are commonly 2x2x2. 
%
% Calculated on a point by point basis.
% Note: by definition, if a point on a shorter fiber is closer to the other
% fiber than Tt, this point does NOT contribute to the overall
% curve-to-curve distance measure.
%
%Dt is above-the-threshold (that is, minus Tt) average point-to-curve
%distance  across all points on a shortest fiber to another fiber.  
%
%  CLARIFY.
% The output variable totalDist is Dt+Tt, the average point-to-curve
% distance between the two fibers. These output arguments are different by
% a constant,  however included since the first one is the "definition" of
% the distance by Zhang et al., and the second one is easier to interpret.
% Also totalDist is reported as at least at Tt (even for two fibers which
% are closer than Tt).
%
%  Example:
%    curve1 = 10*rand(3,10);
%    curve2 = curve1 + 1;
%    Tt = 0;
%    [Dt, totalDist] = InterfiberZhangDistance(curve1, curve2,Tt)
%    [Dt, totalDist] = InterfiberZhangDistance(curve1, curve2,2)
%
%ER 11/2008
%ER 04/2009 added "totalDist" output and introduced a default value for Tt
%to be 0 (all points contribute to the distance measure).

%distance between fibers.

%-  indices is a 1xM vector, whose elements identifies the closest point
%   in dest for each entry in src.

% zero, I guess.
