% [SuperFiber, fg] = dtiComputeSuperFiberRepresentation(fg, [clusterlabels], [numNodes])
%
% Superfibers are a single curve (fiber) that summarizes all of the fibers
% in a single labeled cluster.  For example, one might compute the super
% fiber associated with the arcuate. 
% 
% Create SuperFiber representation of all the fibers assigned to one
% cluster. If numNodes is not provided, it is assumed that they all are
% resampled to same number of Nodes as in fg.fibers{1}.
% 
%  INPUTS:
%    fg            - fiber group structure
%    clusterLabels - Possible labels of the fiber subgroups
%    numNodes      - Number of samples (nodes) along the fiber
%
%  OUTPUTS: 
%   The parameters in the returned representation are:
%   SuperFiber.fibermeans: means (for every coordinate, every node)
%   SuperFiber.fibervarcovs: low diag var/cov matrix for coordinates 
%                          (every node)): [var(x), cov(x, y),
%                          cov(x, z), var(y), cov(y, z), var(z)]
%   SuperFiber.n is number of fibers included in this cluster.
%   fg - returned containes flipped and resampled fibers that produced the
%        superfiber.
%
% Note: while computing superFiber representation, some fibers (or even
% majority of fibers) may have to have been  flipped to group first and
% last points together. The 'fg' returned containes flipped and resampled
% fibers that produced the superfiber.
%
% Algorithm:
%
% All fibers in the group (e.g., optic tract) are resampled to represent
% equal numbers of nodes. We determine the mean and 3D covariance of the
% voxel positions representing that node. We define the core fiber as the
% set of mean positions of the sample nodes. 
%
% In subsequent routines, we determine the weight contributed by each voxel
% to the diffusivity measure using the covariance matrix. Specifically, we
% calculate the Mahalanobis distance of each voxel from the mean. If a
% voxel position is X, the mean position is X0, and the covariance matrix
% of the 3D positions is C, then the Mahalanobis distance, d, is sqrt(delta
% Cinv delta), where X-X0 is delta.
% 
% The assgined weight is the inverse of the distance, d. This procedure
% assigns more weight to fibers close to the core of the bundle, and the
% meaning of close is derived from the distribution of the points at each
% node as captured by the covariance matrix.

%   08/11/2009 ER added checks that all start points and all end points are
%              grouped respectively.
%   09.13.2011 LMP Added comments, example usage, web resources and
