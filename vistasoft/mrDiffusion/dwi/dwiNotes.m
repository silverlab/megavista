% What do we mean by acpc space?  THis means the coords are arranged so
% that (0,0,0) is at the AC and PC is at a point (0,Y,0)
% (Neg X are left, hemisphere).
%
% What do we mean by image space?  This is a translation of ACPC back to
% the raw image indices (but after motion correction).
%
% The coords in ni.data are stored in image coords.
